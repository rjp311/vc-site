  They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder - and that beholder is you! With
  Skinthetics, you can manipulate the appearance of yourself and others to
  whatever your heart desires.

  ## Presenting Skinthetics by Enhance!


  Do you want to change your companion's appearance? Steal their looks for
  yourself? Perhaps even give your adoring fan the face they've always dreamt of
  - yours.


  Skinthetics by Enhance! lets you do all this and more through chemical
  alteration of the human genome. Using Skinthetica, you can manipulate the
  appearances of other humans, and yourself, to your heart's content. Simply
  ingest Skinthetica, and then Reap or Sow your target's appearance at your
  leisure.


  ## This creation adds:


  ### Quest: Skin Deep


  A deserted station near Vega I conceals a shady research program. Uncover the
  misdeeds of Dr. Matthias James, resolve his formula, and reap the rewards of
  the Skinthetics project.


  ### Craftable Chem: Skinthetica


  Use Skinthetica to take, or give, an appearance to any non-crowd Human NPC.
  Ingest the chem, approach a compatible NPC, and use one of the two options
  shown:


  \- **Reap Skin** - Copy the NPC's appearance to yourself.


  \- **Sow Skin** - Copy your appearance to the NPC. Only shows for identical
  body types.


  Skinthetica can be crafted at a Pharmaceutical Lab after researching the
  Skinthetics project. Complete **Skin Deep** to acquire the research project.


  ### Craftable Object: Skinthetic Mannequins


  Want to start a collection of faces? A display in your image for your
  favourite look? Skinthetic Mannequins have you covered.


  Skinthetic Mannequins work with Skinthetica in the same way that living humans
  do. As well as clothes and gear, they can also store appearances for display
  or to take at a later time. Each pose can store one appearance which will
  persist each time it is built.


  You can construct Skinthetic Mannequins upon completion of the Skinthetics
  research project. Additional poses can be unlocked through Outpost Decoration
  research - just like standard mannequins!
