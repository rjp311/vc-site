  ## This creation adds:


  ### Locations: 3 New Chunks Restaurants


  Three new branches of Chunks are available to acquire in Gagarin Landing,
  Cydonia, and HopeTown.


  Each restaurant is a fully-fledged business simulation with trackable metrics,
  upgradeable features and furnishings, and dynamic crowd sizes that change with
  the popularity of your restaurant.


  Each week of in-game time your restaurant will renew it's metrics based on a
  variety of factors and then calculate your profit or loss. If you maintain
  your stock of ingredients, improve your Chunk'o'matic, and train your staff,
  and you'll be pulling in hefty sums of credits every week.


  As a bonus, reaching the maximum professional ratings across all restaurants
  will grant you a special reward and a message from Fred Blombart himself.


  ### Food: 16 New Chunks!


  Completing the new Chunkonomics research tree will unlock new Chunks flavours
  to buy as well as additional features for managing your restaurants.


  Each flavour can be modified to give a performance enhancement by inserting
  additive ingredients into your Chunk'o'matic - but watch out, additive
  ingredients can have negative affects on your customers and metrics.


  ### Weapon: Chunkblower


  Why would Chunks manufacture their own branded microgun? The answer - who
  cares!


  The Chunkblower comes with a full suite of modifications and can be purchased
  from your restaurants after completing Chunkonomics 3.


  ### With Thanks To
