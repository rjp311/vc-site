      #### A bit about myself.

      # The Early Days.


      I'm an all-round Sci-Fi and Doctor Who fan, live with a cat called Maple,
      and consider myself a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to digital work -
      both creative and technical.


      I originally began my content creation hobby trying to make mods for
      Minecraft and new items for TF2 using Blender - but I was young, and not
      very good.


      That didn't stop me. Like mods, websites and Lego - skills are built brick
      by brick through effort and perseverence.

      # Nuclear Fusion.


      As a Doctor Who and Fallout fan, I naturally gravitated towards and was an
      early follower of Fallout Who Vegas (FWV) - a mod committed to fusing
      elements of Doctor Who with the world of Fallout: New Vegas.


      I started tinkering with the G.E.C.K. and a couple of years later, I found
      myself contributing to the project alongside the team my good friend Chris
      had put together.


      I created the companion system, which let you bring otherwise
      unrecruitable NPCs aboard the TARDIS, and granted them a randomised name.
      I also designed and implemented the Trenzalore worldspace and associated
      quest, called 'The Siege', where you have to fight off alien invaders and
      bring about an to end the war.

      # Unfinished Business.


      Chris and I briefly worked on and released a version of Fallout Who for
      Fallout 4, now affectionately named Fallout Who: Grandfather (FWG). The
      tools were new, and it was rough-around-the-edges, but it worked.


      I eventually went off to university to study Computer Science which
      occupied a lot of my attention - but as my time there came to a close, I
      felt a calling to return to modding my favourite games.


      I began the process of rebuilding FWG from the ground up. Taking the best
      elements of FWV, alongside new innovations made in FWG, I built Fallout
      Who: Regenerated (FWR) which was released in 2022 and has received
      incremental updates ever since.

      # The Future.


      I'm privileged to have made some great friends, run an active community,
      and work with some genuinely talented contributors on the projects that I
      love.


      I'm also incredibly appreciative for Bethesda's Verified Creator program.
      The substantial skillset I have built working on these projects, over
      nearly 10 years, has opened up a new avenue for making great content that,
      as a bonus, can earn some pocket money. This has been a great success so
      far, starting with 'Skinthetics by Enhance!' and 'Choose Your Chunks'.


      So, looking ahead, I plan to keep on creating. More Verified Creations,
      more great new features, stories and worlds, and - of course - I'll be
      working on Whofield, bringing that same level of Doctor Who madness to
      Starfield that players of FWV and FWR love and expect.
