      # Interested in contributing?


      I'm regularly on the lookout for people to contribute:


      * 3D Character Work (Clothing / Creatures)

      * 3D Asset Work (Props, Objects, Architecture)

      * Voice Acting


      If you have any of these skills and are interested in any ongoing
      projects, or want to be kept in mind for commissioned work, feel free to
      get in touch.


      ### Fallout Who and Whofield


      Like many community projects, Fallout Who and Whofield wouldn't be what
      they are without the help of talented contributors to add that extra spark
      and really bring the content to life.


      If you like Doctor Who, have a little bit of experience working with
      Bethesda Games, and have any of the relevant skills above then get in
      touch!


      Contributions to free projects are voluntary, on an ad-hoc basis, and
      committment-free. Do what you can, when you can - we all do!


      ### Verified Creations


      As a Verified Creator I can commission paid work for bespoke assets
      produced to spec.


      If you're interested and and would like me to keep you in mind for any
      upcoming projects then please send me a message.
